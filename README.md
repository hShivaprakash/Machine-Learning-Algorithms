# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest ● Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA ● Implement K-Means Clustering ● Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of squares The implementation should only use NumPy and Pandas as external libraries. The implementation should be within the definition of the functions in the predictive_analytics.py file. Any utility function should be defined within its scope.
